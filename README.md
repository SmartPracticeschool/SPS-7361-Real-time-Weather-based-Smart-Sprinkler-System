Real-time Weather based Smart Sprinkler System

The project aims to develop a smart sprinkler system, which continuously monitors the data from soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, updates the IBM IoT platform and stores the data in Cloudant DB. By monitoring the weather forecasting details from the open weather map, the system should control the sprinklers. A mobile App is designed to visualize the data from soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor and the local weather parameters. The mobile app can also be used to control the sprinklers.
